# UGent template for master's thesis

This is a template I created for my master's thesis (engineering) and its presentation. To see a complete use case, see [my master's thesis](https://github.com/Dherse/masterproef).

## Using outside of UGent

I do not recommend it, but it should be mostly okay as long as you:

- [ ] Remove the UGent color (`ugent-blue`) and replace it with your own
- [ ] Do not use the UGent font (`UGent Panno Text`) since it's exclusively license for UGent
- [ ] Remove the page in the preface that are specific to the thesis

### The slides

Do not use the slide template outside of Ghent University-related projects as this is a direct copy of the official template and therefore it depends on their own license!
